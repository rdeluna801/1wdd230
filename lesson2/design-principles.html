        <img src="lesson2/images/Amazon iPhone screenshot.jpeg" alt="mobile screenshot of the amazon.com website"/>
        The design principle is shown by...
        Amazon is the best at having their company name all over the webpage, as well as on all the little icons for prime delivery, or prime subscribe & save, etc.

        Organization/Company Name: <YouTube class="com"></YouTube> 
        <img src="lesson2/images/youtube iPhone screenshot.jpeg" alt="mobile screenshot for the webpage YouTube.com"/>
        The design principle is shown by...
        YouTube has a lot of whitespace for as much content on the screen as they have. You can easily see where videos are, where the information about the videos are, the menu for the website. Everything is equally padded and easy to find.  
      </p>

        Balance and Contrast

        <img src="lesson2/images/Home - The Church of Jesus Christ.jpg" alt="mobile screenshot for the webpage thechurchofjesuschrist.org"/>
        The design principle is shown by...
        Contrast gives the entire website a clean look that immediately draws your eyes to the important content on the page, especially when a shadow effect is used behind the content they want you to see or click on. Everything is completely balanced throughout the entire page, as well as large amounts of whitespace. Actually, I could have used this one site to list all the design principles. I'm impressed.
