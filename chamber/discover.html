            <h3 class="historytitle">A Brief History of Holladay City</h3>
            <p>
                Our Holladay Park was named after Ben Holladay (1819-1887) who planted
                the trees. Here is a history of Ben Holladay. By the spring of 1864,
                Ben Holladay had acquired a dominant portion of the stage, mail, and
                freighting business between the Missouri River and Salt Lake City. He
                controlled 2,670 miles of stage lines and was among the largest
                individual employers in the United States. Holladay sold his routes to
                Wells Fargo Express in 1866 for $1.5 million and moved to Oregon. He
                became involved in a competition to build a railroad south along the
                Willamette River. In 1868 ground was broken for routes along both the
                east and the west sides of the river. Holladay’s “Eastsiders”
                completed 20 miles of track before the competition, which subsequently
                sold out to him. Holladay won a federal subsidy and built the Oregon
                and California Railroad as far south as Roseburg before the Panic of
                1873 financial crisis stopped the effort. In 1876 Henry Villard took
                over the railroad. At his peak, Holladay entertained lavishly and
                spent a great deal of money in an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the
                U.S. Senate. In contrast to his youth growing up in a log cabin, by
                the age of 50 Holladay maintained mansions in Washington D.C., on the
                Hudson River in New York, and in Portland. He also kept an elaborate
                “cottage” at Seaside, Oregon. There are two wonderful books on Ben
                Holladay: Ben Holladay, the Stagecoach King: A Chapter in the
                Development of Transcontinental Transportation, 1940 & 1968 by ​J. V.
                Frederick The Saga of Ben Holladay: Giant of the Old West, 1959 by
                Ellis Lucia There is also a wonderful exhibit about Ben Holladay in
                Seaside, Oregon at the Seaside Historical Society Museum. Holladay
                must have had lots of influence since we have many significant
                properties named after him. Legacy Holladay Park Medical Center
                (Emanuel), Holladay Park Post Office, Holladay Park Plaza, Holladay
                Park Church of God, and NE Holladay Street. Also, Sullivan’s Gulch tax
                properties are identified as Holladay Park Addition by the county and
                state. Written by
